Characters from the message are provided as inputs along with setting to for each character

The test bench takes settings and the information to be encoded/decoded as input.

It gives the encoded/decoded data as the output.

The main module encrypts/decrypts data by changing an alphabet to another alphabet by means of mapping.

The settings indicate what "black-box" must be selected to encode/decode data.

It is to ensure that if the same alphabet is entered multiple times, the output is not the same always.

For example if the code is 3021 for "hello" then 'h' must be encoded with 3, 'e' with 0, 'l' with 2 and so on.

The output generated will be completely random and difficult to decipher.
